# Auto-Generated OpenAPI Bindings to `{{title}}`

The app in `src` provides auto-generated-from-OpenAPI bindings to the {{title}} API.

## run stab-server

Build follows the standard approach to building Stack-based projects.

1. Install the [Haskell `stack` tool](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README).
2. Run `stack build` to build this package.
3. Run `stack run {{host}} {{port}}` to run this app.

However, response json will be wrapped with "data" (for an error response, it'll be "err").
{{=<% %>=}}
```
{"data": {{ResponseObject}}}
```

To solve this probrem, following steps will modify servant-checked-exceptions' source.

1. chmod +x `JSONCompat.sh`
2. Run `JSONCompat.sh`

NOTE: JSONCompat.sh is depend on `sed` and `stack`.

And again, follows standerd apploach.

3. Run `stack build` to build this package.
4. Run `stack run {{host}} {{port}}` to run this app.
